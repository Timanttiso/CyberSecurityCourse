# 2️⃣ Executive Summary

Penetration testing done to the registration page of the booking system with ZAP. The testing showed a lot of faults in the page, such as vulnerabilities to SQL injections, path traversal and the site lacks security in how it stores passwords.

**Overall risk level:** High

**Top 5 immediate actions:**  
1.  Hashing/encrypting passwords in database.
2.  Fix issue with path traversal.
3.  Fix logs exposing username information.
4.  Fix vulnerability to SQL injections.
5.  Fix weak password policy

# 3️⃣ Severity scale & definitions

|  **Severity Level**  | **Description**                                                                                                              | **Recommended Action**           |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
|      🔴 **High**     | A serious vulnerability that can lead to full system compromise or data breach (e.g., SQL Injection, Remote Code Execution). | *Immediate fix required*         |
|     🟠 **Medium**    | A significant issue that may require specific conditions or user interaction (e.g., XSS, CSRF).                              | *Fix ASAP*                       |
|      🟡 **Low**      | A minor issue or configuration weakness (e.g., server version disclosure).                                                   | *Fix soon*                       |
| 🔵 **Info** | No direct risk, but useful for system hardening (e.g., missing security headers).                                            | *Monitor and fix in maintenance* |
